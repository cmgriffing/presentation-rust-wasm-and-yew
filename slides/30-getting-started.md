# Getting Started

## Project Setup: Manually

- Make sure you have Rust and Cargo

  - rustup is recommended

- Get some tooling
  - wasm-pack (recommended)
  - wasm-bindgen (not recommended)
  - cargo-web (older)

pack and bindgen are both by the Rust/Wasm Working Group
(read: official)

wasm-bindgen is used inside wasm-pack
